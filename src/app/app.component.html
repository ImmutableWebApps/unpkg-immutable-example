  <h2>Hosting an <a href="https://immutablewebapps.org">Immutable Web App</a> with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>,
    <a href="https://unpkg.com/#/">UNPKG</a>, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></h2>
    <p>Immutable Web Apps are composed of two concepts:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Immutable Assets:</b> Static assets (javascript, CSS, images) that do not contain any environment-specific
        configuration and are hosted at a permanent, versioned,
        long-term browser cached location.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Deployment Manifest:</b> An <code>index.html</code> that is unique to the environment and not cached by the
        browser. It contains environment-specific configuration, references to the versioned immutable assets, and meta
        data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using a combination of npm, UNPKG, and Github Pages covers nearly all of these requirements!</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>:</b> The software registry stores the the static assets in
        versioned, immutable packages.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b><a href="https://unpkg.com/#/">UNPKG</a>:</b> The CDN makes all assets of the packages on npm addressable
        over https
        and globally available.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>:</b> This static hosting site supports easy
        configuration of DNS and HTTPS, has great integration with GitHub (obviously), and has a short TTL for
        browser caching</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><i>This Immutable Web App is hosted using npm, UNPKG, and GitHub Pages!</i></h2>
    <h3>Project Structure</h3>
    <p>The git repository <a href="https://github.com/ImmutableWebApps/unpkg-immutable-example">unpkg-immutable-example</a>
    is split into two critical branches:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ImmutableWebApps/unpkg-immutable-example/tree/default"><code>default</code></a>
        is where the Angular project is maintained. It was generated from Angular CLI and is maintained like
        any other static web application.</li>
        <br />
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ImmutableWebApps/unpkg-immutable-example/tree/master"><code>master</code></a> is
        configured to serve the GitHub Pages site. It only contains a single file <a href="https://github.com/ImmutableWebApps/unpkg-immutable-example/blob/master/404.html"><code>404.html</code></a>.
        This single file is served for every request made to the GitHub Pages site.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project Lifecycle</h3>
    <h4>Building</h4>
    <p>Developing this web application is the same as any other Angular project. Features are built and tested locally, commits and
        pull requests advance the state of the codebase. When a stable version of the app is ready to be deployed, the
        assets are rendered to the <code>/dist</code> folder using <code>npm run build</code> and new version of the
        project is published to npm using <code>npm publish</code>. The assets become available on <a href="https://unpkg.com/@immutablewebapps/unpkg-immutable-example@0.0.1/">UNPKG</a>.</p>
    <h4>Deploying</h4>
    <p>With the new version of the assets available on UNPKG, an <i>atomic</i> deployment can be triggered by
        switching to the <code>master</code> branch and updating <code>404.html</code> with the new references to project
        assets via UNPKG and any related changes to environment variables. Once the commit is made, GitHub Pages
        deployment is triggered and the new version of the web application is available.</p>
    <h2><i>Deployments!</i></h2>
    <p>With our Immutable Web App hosted by npm/UNPKG and without any environment-specific configuration, deployments
        are cheap and reliable! Let's deploy <code>index.html</code> to wherever it is easiest to setup DNS and HTTPS!</p>
    <h3>Deploy to another Github Pages repository</h3>
    <p><i>and let's change the version!</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/new">new Github repo</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/">Configure the
            repo as a publishing source for Github Pages</a></li>
        <li>Commit the <code>index.html</code> as a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site/">custom
            <code>404</code> page</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://immutablewebapps.org/unpkg-immutable-deployment"><b><i>Deployed!</i></b></a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deploy to Netlify</h3>
    <p><i>and let's change some environment variables!</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Create a Netlify account</a></li>
        <li>Run <code>npm i -g netlify-cli</code></li>
        <li>Run <code>netlify login</code></li>
        <li>Create a folder for the <code>index.html</code></li>
        <li>Run <code>netlify deploy</code></li>
        <li><a href="https://immutablewebapps.netlify.com"><b><i>Deployed!</i></b></a></li>
    </ul>
